      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Imagine your working on a project and you need a picture or a background image to use. So you go online and look for the one you need, but after hours of searching you just cant find the right picture. With my new website, you will be able to find pictures that you can buy and digital artists that you can hire to create the perfect what you need. And while there may be other websites that are able to do the same thing, mine will solely be for art, making the process for finding your picture as easy as possible.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone looking for images or art for a project or a website</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I want the website to be as simple as possible with the first page simply being a page full of pictures with a search bar and a profile login at the top. 
The top images will be the newest images posted to the website, the very first being the newest. The search bar, once used, will show the images found in the search 
below the search bar just as the initial page did but with the filtered results. The profile botton will show the user their profile, liked images, and followed artists.
On the bottom of the profile page will be the help links and other social media links. When viewing someone elses profile you will be able to see a small bio about them
and be able to message them about their art. 
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <img src="./pics/trippy_pond.jfif" alt="image for page">
      </ul>
      <h3>ARTIST PROFILES </h3>
      <p>
        They will also be able to look at artists profiles to see if they would be someone that they might want to have create something 
for them. Anyone will be able to access the website and use the publicly given pictures for their own use, but they will need an account to
be able to follow artists and keep a list of liked images. If the person using the website has an account, they will also be able to message artists
about commissioning them to create something for them. If a user would like to become an artist themselves, they can simply upload their own art through 
their profile and people will be able to search for it. Once a user uploads an image, it will be put to the top of the main home screen, allowing anyone
that is visiting the page to find their artwork. This will create exposure for artists just starting out.

      <h3>HELP</h3>
      <p>
        I want to have a place where they can reach out to the website managers and can ask questions or voice concerns. I also would like to have a place where people 
can give their ideas to help improve the website and make it more user friendly for future users. Included in this will have the website email, social media links 
and a suggestions/comments box.
